# Modeling-agents-in-Scala

This project is made for laboratory work 5-6. "Modeling agents in Scala"


Purpose: familiarization with the methods of modeling multi-agent systems in the Scala language using the package:   scala.actors
 

Tasks:

1. Install and configure scala and sbt (https://alexarchambault.github.io/posts/2020-09-21-cs-setup.html).
2. UPDATED! Learn Scala Actors: A Short Tutorial. Make a short essay on the package and compare it with Akka Actors. Since the package is obsolete and removed from the language, you will not be able to complete the tutorial (in version Scala 2.10.x, you can still complete this tutorial).
3. Learn the Akka toolkit. Take a short tutorial on akka actors: Simple Scala Akka Actor examples (Hello, world examples).
Realize the solution of the task from the wampus world in Scala using the Akka Actors package.
